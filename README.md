# [First Project: Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge (Project Overview)](https://github.com/Gabe-Maja/Load-Shortfall-Regression-Project.git)
  1. In this project, working party and I were tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. 
  2. The `load_shortfall_3h` (3-Hour Daily Shortfall) was modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc.
  3. We then performed some Exploratory Data Analysis to get an understanding of the data.
  4. Feature Engineerning was then done to convert all non-numerical Features into numerical ones. The DateTime variable was used to engineer new Features.
  5. Multiple Linear Regression was used as a baseline model. We also made use of Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor in order to reach the best model.
  6. The Model was then successfully deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. 
  Finally, we presented our Research findings and model to a panel of specialist.
